Data Collection and Processing with Python

This repository contains the code and materials for the three-week training course on Data Collection and Processing with Python offered by Coursera and Michigan University. The course covers various topics including REST API, map list comprehensions, and working with nested data. All credits for the course content go to Coursera and Michigan University.
Course Contents

The course is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of data collection and processing. The main topics covered in each part are as follows:

    REST API:
        Introduction to REST API and its applications
        Making API requests using Python's requests library
        Handling JSON data received from API responses

    Map List Comprehensions:
        Understanding list comprehensions and their usage
        Applying map functions and lambda expressions
        Transforming and manipulating data using list comprehensions

    Nested Data:
        Working with nested data structures such as dictionaries and lists
        Extracting, manipulating, and processing data from nested structures
        Handling complex data relationships and structures

Course Project

At the end of the course, a project was assigned that combines the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the three weeks. The project involved the following tasks:

    Utilizing the TasteDive API:
        Providing a movie, band, or TV show as a query input to the TasteDive API
        Retrieving a set of related items based on the query input

    Utilizing the OMDB API:
        Providing a movie title as a query input to the OMDB API
        Obtaining data about the movie, including scores from various review sites such as Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB

    Combining and Sorting Related Movies:
        Using TasteDive to obtain related movies for a list of titles
        Combining the resulting lists of related movies
        Sorting the combined list according to the Rotten Tomatoes scores (requires additional API calls to the OMDB API)
